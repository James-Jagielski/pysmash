# PySmash

This game is a clone of the popular Super Smash Bros. Our goal for this project was to create a working Super Smash Bros clone that can be played over a server. We wanted to learn how to make a game utlizing networking and servers in python. We thought this project of Super Smash Bros would give us a perfect opportunity for this. The server aspect of this project is the most unique feature to the game because it is something that we were not taught in class. We implemented the model, view, and controller method to the game.
